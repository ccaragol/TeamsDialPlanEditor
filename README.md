# TeamsDialPlanEditor
Microsoft Phone System (Teams) Dial Plan Editor

This is an early version of my GUI for editing Microsoft Phone System (Teams\Skype) tenant dial plans.  I created it because I occasionally need to add, change, and remove normalization rules from a tenant dial plan and get tired of looking up how to do it each time in PowerShell.  I do expect this type of thing to hit the admin center someday, but I can't say for sure or when.  Hopefully this will help you as well.  Lots of new features to come soon.

Updated - Now includes:

Testing the effective normalization for a dialed number
Copying a normalization rule to another dial plan
Reorder the normalization rules by priority
 

New features coming include:

Enter and extension range and generate a normalization rule.
Maybe assign the dial plan to a single or group of users?
Signing the code so it just runs without a warning
Error catching (yeah, it's not there, early version)
Cleaning up the code in general, it's messy
Let me know if there are some other features you'd like to see.
